{"summary":"The differential includes surface disease (dry eye, allergic conjunctivitis) versus neuromuscular and orbital causes of diplopia and eyelid findings (superior oblique palsy, ocular myasthenia gravis, thyroid orbitopathy, decompensated phoria). A structured approach with anterior segment evaluation, tear assessment, allergy workup, ocular motility/alignment tests, neuromuscular fatigue testing, serologies, thyroid studies, and orbital imaging will help distinguish these entities.","options":[ "Slit lamp examination with fluorescein staining and tear break-up time", "Schirmer tear test", "Allergy testing (skin prick or conjunctival provocation)", "Cover-uncover and alternate cover tests with prism measurement", "Parkâ€™s three-step test for superior oblique palsy", "Forced duction test", "Ice-pack test for ocular myasthenia gravis", "Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody assay", "Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4)", "Orbital imaging (CT or MRI)" ]}
